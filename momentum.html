    <H1>MOMENTUM MENTAL HEALTH AWARDS</H1>
    <H2>BRAND IDENTITY, PRINT AND EVENT DESIGN</H2>
    Momentum Walk-In Counselling was in need of a brand identity and various print and electronic deliverables for the 2018 Momentum Awards, the inaugural celebration of Edmonton’s mental health community. The awards brand plays off of Momentum’s existing colours, and focuses on three main themes: the brain, the helping hand and the speech bubble.

        <blockquote>“Mimi was wonderful to work with over the course of the 2019 and 2020 Momentum Mental Health Awards (MMHA). Providing design support, she was instrumental in crafting and fine-tuning the branding for the awards and all of the required collateral. Deliverables were always ready on time and executed in alignment with the vision of the MMHA team and the Momentum brand. She was clear in her communications and expectations were always met. I could not recommend her services enough.” <br><h3>Sarah Parrotta, Marketing & Events Support<br>Momentum Mental Health Awards</h3></blockquote>
