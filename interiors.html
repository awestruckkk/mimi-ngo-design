        <h2>BRAND IDENTITY AND WEBSITE CREATION</h2>
        Tionna, an interior designer and the owner of Interiors by T, had a very big, almost impossible dream of creating a website that took visitors out of their screens and into creative her mind. I designed and built a website reminiscent of what I imagine Tionna’s desk would look like. Paint, scissors, brushes and other tools all laid out on a canvas, with navigation links that looked like her scribbles in a notebook. To align her brand with her beautiful new website, I created a new logo, colour palette and brand identity for her. <br><br>
   Created with Rogue52 Marketing<br>
